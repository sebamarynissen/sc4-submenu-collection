# SimCity 4 Submenu Collection

A collection of third-party submenus for use with [memo's Submenus DLL](https://github.com/memo33/submenus-dll).

While not functional yet, the idea is that this repo allows easily adding new submenus by simply adding them in a human-friendly format to the folder structure.
From then on, a build script takes over and compiles the entire folder structure to `.dat` files that will create the submenu functionality.
